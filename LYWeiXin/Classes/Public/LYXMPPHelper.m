 * Servers have the option of requiring connections to be secured during the opening process.
 * If this is the case, the XMPPStream will automatically attempt to properly secure the connection.
 *
 * The possible keys and values for the security settings are well documented.
 * Some possible keys are:
 * - kCFStreamSSLLevel
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsExpiredCertificates
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsExpiredRoots
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsAnyRoot
 * - kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain
 * - kCFStreamSSLPeerName
 * - kCFStreamSSLCertificates
 *
 * Please refer to Apple's documentation for associated values, as well as other possible keys.
 *
 * The dictionary of settings is what will be passed to the startTLS method of ther underlying AsyncSocket.
 * The AsyncSocket header file also contains a discussion of the security consequences of various options.
 * It is recommended reading if you are planning on implementing this method.
 *
 * The dictionary of settings that are initially passed will be an empty dictionary.
 * If you choose not to implement this method, or simply do not edit the dictionary,
 * then the default settings will be used.
 * That is, the kCFStreamSSLPeerName will be set to the configured host name,
 * and the default security validation checks will be performed.
 *
 * This means that authentication will fail if the name on the X509 certificate of
 * the server does not match the value of the hostname for the xmpp stream.
 * It will also fail if the certificate is self-signed, or if it is expired, etc.
 *
 * These settings are most likely the right fit for most production environments,
 * but may need to be tweaked for development or testing,
 * where the development server may be using a self-signed certificate.
